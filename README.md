# calculator

A very simple but feature bloated calculator built in Flutter targeting Web, Android, iOS and MacOS

## Features

* Its a calculator that can add and subtract. Its definitely not built in the most efficient way and
 can also not easily be expanded to cater for more operators.
* It saves a history of your previous equations every time you pres "=".
* It loads Albums as a single `Future` and a `Stream` of 10 Albums.
* It connects you to _Postman_'s echo web socket so that you can talk to yourself.
* There is a VERY basic widget test file just to see how it works.
* It is runnable on Web, Android, iOS and MacOS.
